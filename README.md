SailsBluePrintActions
=====================
To install, place the action files (find.js, findone.js ect . . .) in your api/blueprints folder

##What is this? 
Sails.js now has custom blueprint actions that will overide the default actions on your api. I put this together in hopes that we could share different tricks and techniques to perform various tasks that might be outside the current core of the sails.js project. 

Sails.js docs on blueprints and custom actions
http://www.sailsjs.org/#!/documentation/reference/blueprint-api

These files were added with the inital commit being the default action provided by sails, so people could see the changes made, thus giving them the ability to cherry pick and creat their own custom action. 

Please make suggestions on how this can be better orgainized or contribute your own custom actions!
